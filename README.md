# Infinity Wallet Deprecated
<br/>

**Dear Visitor**,

The Infinity Wallet software has been deprecated and is no longer supported. While the software may continue to partially function due to its non-custodial nature, functionality may at some time be no longer available. Any further usage continues to be at your own risk.

As a self-custodial wallet software, you hold your own crypto and control over your wallet. You can easily import your wallet for use in other self-custodial wallet softwares using your 12 or 24 word seed phrase, or alternatively the private key for a coin.

> [!WARNING]
> **NEVER** share your 12 or 24 word seed phrase or private keys with anyone! The seed phrase and private keys are your wallet. Anyone that knows the seed phrase or a coin's private key has full and permanent control of that wallet, sharing would compromise the security of your crypto.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always keep a secure backup of your 12 or 24 word seed phrase in a safe place. This will allow you to be able to recover your wallet across any supporting non-custodial wallet softwares or self generate your wallet keys from the seed phrase. Without the 12 or 24 word seed phrase you will not be able to recover the wallet.

The Infinity Wallet does not hold your crypto or operate any services. As a non-custodial wallet software, the Infinity Wallet was only a tool/interface to interact with public decentralized blockchains. This allows you to retain complete control of your crypto, without being dependent on a third party to hold your crypto. As such by using the Infinity Wallet, all actions and crypto you hold are your own responsibility. Your crypto is under your complete control and management directly on the blockchain using any compatible non-custodial wallet softwares.
 
## What this means for you:
The Infinity Wallet will no longer receive any updates or technical support, as such you may find that the wallet does not fully function, be bug-free or secure to use. Any further usage continues to be at your own risk.

**Making the switch is simple:**
You can easily recover/import your wallet 12 or 24 word seed phrase into another trusted non-custodial wallet software. Just like that your wallet will be accessible in another non-custodial wallet interface to manage and transact, without the need to transfer any crypto.

<br/>

> [!CAUTION]
> **Be aware of scams!** 
>
> Anyone contacting you via email, phone or other contact methods offering FREE CRYPTO, RECOVERED CRYPTO, or CRYPTO FOR A FEE/DEPOSIT is generally someone attempting to scam/fraud. You should never blindly believe what someone tells you, as anyone could say anything or impersonate anyone. Always be careful with unknown or unofficial contacts and verify the contact source.
>
> Also, be aware of manually importing tokens that someone tells you to import. Always make sure to research and verify a token's validity before importing a token. Anyone can create a token with any name on the blockchain, this does not mean that the token has any value.
